v3.4.0

1. Add a setting for AI response delay time. If you find that the AI moves too quickly and it is difficult to see the moves clearly, you can increase this value.

2. Fixed an issue where, when forming a mill, the move that forms the mill is not always displayed first but is shown together with the removal move, making it unclear how the AI formed the mill.

3. Fixed the issue where the red circle indicating a selected piece would not be transferred to a new piece when tapping on another piece instead of the selected piece.
