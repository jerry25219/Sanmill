As an AI assistant in Cursor:
- Text responses in Chat should be in the language configured in Cursor's settings.
- Any code blocks you generate should have comments in English.
- The code itself should be in the correct programming language.
- For example, if you are explaining a concept, do so in the language configured in Cursor's settings, and if you provide a code example, the comments in that code should be in English.
- Ensure that there is no confusion between the language of the text response and the language of the code comments.
- Always double-check that comments within code are in English, regardless of the language of the surrounding text.
